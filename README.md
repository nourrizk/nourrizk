Hello 👋, I’m Nour

I am a 4th-year MEng student at Ecole Polytechnique, concurrently pursuing a Master of Artificial Intelligence at PSL Research University - a joint program offered by Université Paris Dauphine, Ecole Normale Supérieure & Ecole des Mines Paris.

My interests encompass Machine and Deep Learning, Data Science, Computer Graphics, and Visual Computing. I am passionate about contributing to the development of innovative technologies that transform our daily lives (and let’s be honest, who doesn’t use ChatGPT or Claude? 😄), our industries, societal challenges, diverse markets, and even the healthcare sector. Let's talk AI⚡.

Feel free to contact me for collaborating on projects, hackathons or for simply sharing a coffee. 
  
Sincerely, Nour.
